The Firebase Authentication SDK's `onAuthStateChanged` listener might not trigger reliably if there are rapid changes in the authentication state, such as repeated sign-in and sign-out attempts in quick succession. This can lead to unexpected behavior or failure to update the UI accordingly.  This is often exacerbated in environments with poor network connectivity where authentication events might be delayed or dropped.
